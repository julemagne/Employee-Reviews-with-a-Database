# Employee Reviews with a Database

ERD at https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3143423e-d66f-4483-be79-3c0dfd255923

Using TDD, this code creates classes of Departments and Employees, then uses Ruby and SQL to populate databases with the information. You can use this code to:

-Return the total number of employees in a department.

-Return the employee who is being paid the least in a department.

-Return all employees in a department, ordered alphabetically by name.

-Return all employees who are getting paid more than the average salary.

-Return all employees with names which are palindromes.

-Return the department with the most employees.

-Move everyone from one department to another department.

-Give a raise of 10% to ALL employees with good reviews. This is different from the raise method which already
-exists, and also needs to operate over all employees of ALL departments.
